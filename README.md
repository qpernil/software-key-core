# software-key-core

`software-key-core` provides protocol-neutral software key operations shared by
security-token providers and device emulators.

The crate owns reusable RSA, elliptic-curve, Ed25519 and X25519 key generation,
public-key projection, signing, verification and raw key agreement. Its
symmetric primitives cover AES ECB/CBC, CCM with both general and Yubico OTP
profiles, and AES key wrap with padding. Supported Weierstrass curves include
P-224/P-256/P-384/P-521, secp256k1, and Brainpool P-256/P-384/P-512. Classical
asymmetric keys also support PKCS#8 import/export at protocol boundaries such
as YubiHSM RSA-AES key wrapping.

It does not own protocol identifiers, PKCS #11 types, device authorization,
persistence, transport framing, or protocol-specific error mapping.

The local consumers intentionally use dependency-by-path so each working
directory directly represents the code being built:

```text
software-key-core
├── ../pkcs11rs
├── ../virtual-yubikey
└── ../virtual-yubihsm
```

## Development

Run the standalone test suite with:

```console
cargo test
```

The crate is not currently published. Consumers should continue using the
local path until repository and release metadata are established.
